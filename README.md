# us-law-playback

In the US, the president has final say on accepting or rejecting a merge request.

When the laws are being negotiated, they should be viewable by the American people so they can comment and provide feedback.
Each suggested change to a potential law should be annotated with the person or group submitting that change.
In order to achieve that goal, the existing laws should be recorded in the same manner.

This project replicates the building of the history.
Each file represents a raw change.
The historic_record.json contains the actions that will build the git history.

The result is a git history that shows how the laws of the law would look if they had started in a version control system.
